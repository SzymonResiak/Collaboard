# Collaboard
Organize teams into collaborative groups, manage tasks across kanban boards, and track progress seamlessly—all in one unified workspace.

---

## Overview  
**Collaboard** is a collaborative productivity app designed to simplify teamwork through structured **Groups**, **Boards**, and **Tasks**. Built for flexibility, it empowers teams to manage workflows, track progress, and stay aligned—all in one intuitive space.

## Key Features  

### 🧑🤝🧑 **Groups**  
- Create **groups** for teams, projects, or departments.  
- Invite members with roles: **Creator**, **Admin**, or **Contributor**.  
- Every group starts with at least one member (the creator).  

### 📋 **Boards**  
- Design **kanban-style boards** within groups (*To-Do, In Progress, Done*).  
- Each board belongs to **group** for focused collaboration.  

### ✅ **Tasks**  
- Break work into **tasks** with descriptions, checklists, attachments, and comments.  
- Drag-and-drop tasks across boards for seamless progress tracking.  
- **Assignees** can update tasks, while **creators** (group/board admins) retain editing rights.

---

- 🎯 **Hierarchical Structure**: Groups → Boards → Tasks for clarity and scalability.  
- 👑 **Admin Control**: Group/board creators can edit any task, even unassigned ones.  
- ✏️ **Assignee Flexibility**: Task assignees update their work directly.

## Example Workflow

2. **Dev Team** (Group) → **Sprint #5** (Board) → Tasks: *Fix Bug #123, Deploy API, Test UI*.
